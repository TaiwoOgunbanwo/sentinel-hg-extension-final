    <h1>Sentinel HG Extension Test Page</h1>
    <p>This page contains test content to verify the extension is working correctly.</p>

    <div class="test-content">
        <h3>Test Content 1 (Should be detected as hateful)</h3>
        <p>This is some terrible content that contains hate speech. I really hate this and think it's awful. The person who wrote this is an idiot and should be ashamed.</p>
        <p>This paragraph should remain normal and readable. It doesn't contain any hate speech keywords.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="test-content">
        <h3>Test Content 2 (Should be normal)</h3>
        <p>This is some normal content that should not be flagged. It's just regular text about everyday things. Nothing offensive here.</p>
        <p>Another normal paragraph with regular content. No problematic language in this section.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="test-content">
        <h3>Test Content 3 (Should be detected as hateful)</h3>
        <p>Another piece of disgusting content with vile language. This is worthless trash that nobody should read. The author is a moron.</p>
        <p>This is a normal paragraph mixed with the hateful content above. It should remain readable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="test-content">
        <h3>Test Content 4 (Should be normal)</h3>
        <p>More normal content here. Just regular text that should pass through without any issues. No problematic language.</p>
        <p>Final paragraph with completely normal content. Everything here should be perfectly readable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="test-content">
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
